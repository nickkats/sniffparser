sniffparser V1

This script extracts the packets from a `K12 text file` exported by Wireshark.
There isn't much error handling, and it isn't optimized,  as such I don't recommend
this to be used in production, although you do you.

Example command line call:
python sniffparser.py ./blah.txt ./data.dat [-v]

The input file can be created in Wireshark by going to:
File > Export Specified Packets
And selecting "K12 text file" as the "Save as type".
